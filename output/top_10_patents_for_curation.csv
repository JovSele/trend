0.7549111197920779,Thermal cycler for automatic performance of the polymerase chain reaction with close temperature control,"An instrument for performing highly accurate PCR employing a sample block in microtiter tray format. The sample block has local balance and local symmetry. A three zone film heater controlled by a computer and ramp cooling solenoid valves also controlled by the computer for gating coolant flow through the block controls the block temperature. Constant bias cooling is used for small changes. Sample temperature is calculated instead of measured. A platen deforms plastic caps to apply a minimum acceptable threshold force for seating the tubes and thermally isolates them. A cover isolates the block. The control software includes diagnostics. An install program tests and characterizes the instrument. A new user interface is used. Disposable, multipiece plastic microtiter trays to give individual freedom to sample tubes are taught.",1995,634,78,89,,,,https://lens.org/144-225-956-865-164

0.6693587839862138,Controller interface with multiple day programming,"A controller equipped with a user interface having multiple-day programming capabilities, including methods of programming such devices, are disclosed. The user interface may include one or more menus or screens that can be used to program a schedule for one or more selected days during the week. An illustrative method of programming the controller may include the steps of entering a scheduling routine, selecting multiple days for schedule modification, changing the schedule parameters for one or more periods during the selected days, and then exiting the scheduling routine.",2006,478,99,17,,,,https://lens.org/117-429-207-626-233
0.6606195886189681,Environmental condition control and energy management system and method,"An indoor environmental condition control and energy management system includes a plurality of inputs. A user input receives user input parameters including a desired indoor environmental condition range for at least one energy unit price point. An indoor environmental condition input receives a sensed indoor environmental condition. An energy price input receives a schedule of projected energy unit prices per time periods. A processor, coupled to the inputs, computes an environmental condition deadband range for multiple energy unit price points based on the user input parameters and controls at least one energy-consuming load device to maintain the indoor environmental condition within the computed deadband range for a then-current energy unit price point. In an embodiment, the environmental condition includes at least temperature and the at least one load device includes a heating and cooling system. The processor, in one embodiment, communicates through a communications link with at least one energy supply company and selects one energy supply company for a premise to minimize energy consumption cost.",2001,949,63,12,,,,https://lens.org/156-889-107-198-448
0.6454433232009988,Wound cleansing apparatus,"An apparatus for cleansing and promoting tissue growth in wounds, in which irrigant fluid optionally containing cell nutrients and/or other physiologically active material from a reservoir connected to a conformable wound dressing and wound exudate from the dressing are recirculated by a device for moving fluid through a flow path which passes through the dressing, a biodegradable scaffold in contact with the wound bed and a means for fluid cleansing and back to the dressing. The apparatus has means for supplying thermal energy to the fluid in the wound. The cleansing means (which may be a single-phase, e.g. micro-filtration, system or a two-phase, e.g. dialytic system) removes materials deleterious to wound healing, and the cleansed fluid, still containing materials that are beneficial in promoting wound healing, is returned to the wound bed. The dressing and a method of treatment using the apparatus.",2016,349,57,26,,,,https://lens.org/069-088-499-888-849
0.6365690271380873,Parallel reactor with internal sensing,"An apparatus and method for carrying out and monitoring the progress and properties of multiple reactions is disclosed. The method and apparatus are especially useful for synthesizing, screening, and characterizing combinatorial libraries, but also offer significant advantages over conventional experimental reactors as well. The apparatus generally includes multiple vessels for containing reaction mixtures, and systems for controlling the stirring rate and temperature of individual reaction mixtures or groups of reaction mixtures. In addition, the apparatus may include provisions for independently controlling pressure in each vessel, and a system for injecting liquids into the vessels at a pressure different than ambient pressure. In situ monitoring of individual reaction mixtures provides feedback for process controllers, and also provides data for determining reaction rates, product yields, and various properties of the reaction products, including viscosity and molecular weight.",2001,355,37,34,,,,https://lens.org/137-360-122-849-860
